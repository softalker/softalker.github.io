  In biology, abiogenesis, or informally the origin of life (OoL), is the natural process by which life has arisen from non-living matter, 
  such as simple organic compounds
</p>
<p>    
  While the details of this process are still unknown, the prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition 
  from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but an evolutionary process of increasing complexity that involved molecular 
  self-replication, self-assembly, autocatalysis, and the emergence of cell membranes
</p>
<p>
  Although the occurrence of abiogenesis is uncontroversial among scientists, its possible mechanisms are poorly understood
